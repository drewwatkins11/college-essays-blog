<h2 id="Basics-of-Social-Media"><a href="#Basics-of-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Basics of Social Media"></a>Basics of Social Media</h2><p>As the world transitions to a more web-based, information-rich, interaction model, the ways companies need to communicate with their potential customers will have to change. Today, anyone with internet access has a voice, and this makes it more challenging for businesses to connect with and be heard by customers as they are bombarded with so much information.</p>
<p>As part of this adaptation, content marketing is becoming more valuable that traditional sales techniques.[^fn_1] The ability to create a story around a brand or product, capture followers for that story, and convert them into loyal customers can have far greater effects than sending a postcard or taking out an ad in the paper ever could. It is important to keep in mind that even though there are many products out there which allow businesses to push ads to consumers, campaigns which do not create engagement or loyalty will underperform.</p>
<p>It is also important to apply this strategy of content marketing to online tools. Though it is incredibly easy to take out an ad on Facebook, one must be careful to create value in these ads. Though advertising a product will bring about a sale, it will not make for a loyal customer. According to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3009543/dialed/a-top-linkedin-exec-on-why-content-marketing-matters-more-than-ever" target="_blank" rel="external">Fast Company</a>, there are several tips which can help a business to create content.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Prioritize Value</li>
<li>Keep Your Audience Interested</li>
<li>Be Human</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Prioritizing value above the sale is perhaps the most important point to consider. Going back to creating content over advertising, when a customer sees content which adds value, it helps to gain a follow, and in turn, a customer. One can add value through many methods, including engaging the customer, publishing content with respect to timeliness[^fn_2], and providing context relevant to the user.[^fn_3]</p>
<p>The second major point is keeping your audience interested. When the audience is not interested in the item, they are likely to ignore the ad, or even take measures to block your social media account for appearing again. Methods of keeping the audience interested go back to not only creating value, but also targeting a specific demographic to see your ad. This keeps one’s valuable advertising dollars from being wasted on a demographic which doesn’t even care. It’s encouraged to get as granular as necessary when creating targeted ads.</p>
<p>Finally, a company should try to be human in their ad campaigns. Humor, commentary, and light banter (related to the brand, of course) can all go a long ways towards establishing trust and credibility with a user.</p>
<h2 id="Overview-of-Social-Media-Platforms"><a href="#Overview-of-Social-Media-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Overview of Social Media Platforms"></a>Overview of Social Media Platforms</h2><h3 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h3><h4 id="What-is-Facebook"><a href="#What-is-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="What is Facebook?"></a>What is Facebook?</h4><p>As one of the original and most commonly used social networks, Facebook also has one of the strongest fanbases for entrepreneurs to target. Currently, Facebook has roughly 1.23 billion users worldwide, which is an absolutely astronomical number. In fact, it is higher than the entire developed world population (1.2 billion in 2003, according to the <a href="http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2013/2013-world-population-data-sheet.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Population Reference Bureau</a>).</p>
<p>Started in 2004, Facebook was originally just a place to share updates between college students. As it grew, it reached more and more people, till it opened it’s doors to all and the flood of users started using the network. As more users began to use the site, it also allowed businesses to create specific pages to showcase their brand. Along with this came advertising.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook offers a large stable of products, including Facebook for both desktop and mobile, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Among these products are also a slew of marketing opportunities for brands to take part in.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Facebook"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Facebook?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Facebook?</h4><p>One of the original ways to monetize on Facebook was through the use of advertising in the sidebar. Much like Google Adwords, these ads are based on an auction system. Depending on the number of ads available for a given space and the amount of money budgeted for these ads, advertisers are given a price either per thousand impressions or per click. Facebook is constantly redesigning it’s site though, and the trend has been towards increasing ad real estate while increasing ad size. This has resulted 25% less ads per page while causing the average price of an ad to increase by 123%[^fn-fb-usage].</p>
<p>Perhaps a better option for Facebook pages is to publish updates which go directly to users’ newsfeeds by publishing content to their page. Much like personal users can post updates to their timelines, Facebook business users can also post these sorts of updates. Though without the paid advertising, the reach won’t be as high, by publishing engaging content, it can help a business reach a large audience of it’s followers. Businesses on Facebook can also pay to promote these posts in user’s newsfeeds, much like how they are able to run ads.</p>
<p>Across Facebook, the principles of content advertising apply more than they ever have in the past. In fact, recently Facebook created a “zero organic reach” policy for overly promotional posts. Essentially, Facebook users can’t run ads without paying for an actual ad. In all actuality, there is research that Facebook marketers should have been avoiding these sorts of ads from the start. According to PageLever, a third-party Facebook analytics service, 1 in 50 posts are hidden or given some sort of negative feedback by users[^fn-fb-hide]. In these cases, page fans actually will elect to hide all posts from a page or report it as spam much more than hiding that one particuar post. By utilizing the principles of content marketing as opposed to just posting ads, Facebook marketers can ensure success and a wide reach on this increasing growing social network.</p>

<h4 id="Case-Study-Ford-Trucks"><a href="#Case-Study-Ford-Trucks" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: Ford Trucks"></a>Case Study: Ford Trucks</h4><p>Ford has a very strong content marketing strategy across it’s brands. One of it’s most engaging is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fordtrucks" target="_blank" rel="external">Ford Trucks</a>. As America’s top selling vehicle for 32 years and the top truck for 43, the brand has a huge number of loyal followers. As Ford knows the success of it’s brand is based upon these loyal customers, it focuses on engaging them, not selling ads. Ford’s content strategy is to show a selection of videos, product news, and behind-the-scenes content. Where Ford Trucks really excels though, is in it’s fan engagement. Through posting photos of fan’s trucks, creating video content based around fan challenges, and maintaining an open communication network with fans, Ford Trucks exemplifies what it takes to take a content-first approach to marketing on social media.</p>

<h3 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h3><h4 id="What-is-Twitter"><a href="#What-is-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="What is Twitter?"></a>What is Twitter?</h4><p>With 284 million monthly active users, Twitter is one of the largest social networks out there behind Facebook. As opposed to image-based or post-based social networks, Twitter is based around the act of sending 140 character “tweets”. The upside to this limit is that Twitter is very much a tool for updates, news, and conversations, as opposed to static content.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Twitter"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Twitter?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Twitter?</h4><p>Like most social networks, Twitter allows for users to publish ads which appear right in a user’s newsfeed. Twitter also allows large brands to pay to have a certain topic trend in front of millions of users.</p>
<p>The real story of how Twitter is useful to small businesses is it’s focus on conversation. Nowadays, Twitter is used as a support tool and recommendation engine. Users expect a near-immediate reply when tweeting to a company’s social media account and want to have authentic conversation with companies. In addition, because of the huge reach that a tweet has, it has the potential to make or destroy a brand. For example, when a user tweeted a photo of an 11 inch Subway footlong, it caused a massive uproar and created a lot of negative publicity for Subway.</p>
<p>Additionally, Twitter uses hashtags to help categorize content. Many brands have created a trend of using hashtags to gain free publicity through the use of hashtags representing the brand. For example</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="Case-Study-Newcastle-Brown-Ale-Newcastle"><a href="#Case-Study-Newcastle-Brown-Ale-Newcastle" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: Newcastle Brown Ale (@Newcastle)"></a>Case Study: Newcastle Brown Ale (<a href="https://twitter.com/Newcastle" target="_blank" rel="external">@Newcastle</a>)</h4><p>Newcastle Brown Ale has taken a creative approach to online advertising and content marketing by creating a campaign based around the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBollocks" target="_blank" rel="external">#NoBollocks</a>. Their content actually has very little to do with their beers, but instead is based around time-wasting and sarcastic, but hilarious content. They also employ strategies such as massive fan giveaways, such as one campaign where they gave out 50,000 $1 checks for following them. Throughout all this content strategy, Newcastle gets their brand out there and get people curious about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><h4 id="What-is-Instagram"><a href="#What-is-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="What is Instagram?"></a>What is Instagram?</h4><p>Based primarily around telling stories through photos as opposed to text, Instagram has quickly grown into one of the most popular social networks out there. That said, the culture of Instagram is very personal and private. They do not have a public advertising program and are still more focused on curating content than monetization at this point.</p>
<p>The primary method of gaining followers on the network is through word of mouth and following brands a user is loyal towards. Though this is a roadblock to quickly reaching a large number of followers, the followers a business does gain are likely to engage with content and be more loyal than followers on other platforms.</p>
<p>Another key compenent of Instagram is the use of hashtags. Used the same way as they are on Twitter, hashtags allow a user to quickly see a certain category of content from across accounts. Additionally, there has been a sort of tradition that has popped up through Twitter’s hashtags, for example, #tbt for Throwback Thursday. These represent great opportunities for brands to appear human to users.</p>
<p>Recently, Instagram has started exploring paid advertising through the use of “Sponsored Posts”. These are images which are placed in a user’s newsfeed from businesses which the user does not follow. The trick to this is not invading a user’s privacy or sense of community, and is currently in the alpha stages of a full scale rollout, with only about 10 brands invited to use it. For now, the option is not available to small businesses or the public.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Instagram"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Instagram?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Instagram?</h4><p>Instagram is perhaps the most curated social network out there, and despite it’s size, users are protective of the exclusivity awarded to them by the simple feed and only seeing users they wish to look at. This culture, combined with the fact that sponsored posts are currently only available to a very small number of users, forces customers to prioritze content above all.</p>
<p>According to Instagram’s <a href="[http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/76235731349/tools-and-tips-to-help-marketers-inspire-and]">business site</a>, there are several tips a small business can use when beginning to market on the platform:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be True to Your Brand</strong> - Photos should be representative of one’s brand, not just simple text or a generic image.</li>
<li><strong>Share Experiences</strong> - Show the adventure or emotion which comes with using a brand. What does a photo evoke in a user?</li>
<li><strong>Find Beauty Everywhere</strong> - Even industrial machines or a muddy field can be made into a beatiful image. Look at the world through a creative lens.</li>
<li><strong>Inspire Action</strong> - Use hashtags to allow users to create their own content and give your brand momentum. For example, how <a href="[[http://instagram.com/nike]">@Nike’s</a> hashtag, <a href="[http://iconosquare.com/tag/justdoit]">#justdoit</a>, caught on.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Audience</strong> - If your audience is comprised of foodies, or of sports fans, or of families, your content should reflect that. Know your audience and cater to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like many social media sites, before joining Instagram, a business should be ready for the commitment. Instagram is a very personal platform, and businesses should be wary of what that may involve. Additionally, Instagram is a simple phone app and doesn’t offer any sort of insights or metrics to gain feedback about ROI or engagement. What businesses see is what everyone sees.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="Case-Study-salutkitchenbar"><a href="#Case-Study-salutkitchenbar" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: @salutkitchenbar"></a>Case Study: @salutkitchenbar</h4><p>There are many successful examples of businesses marketing through Instagram. Some notable examples include Southwest Airlines, Deschutes Brewery, and TSA. One that particularly stands out from experience though is a small wine bar in Tempe. Salut Kitchen Bar is a trendy, urban, wine bar in a college town. As such, it naturally turned to Instagram to reach it’s target market. Each photo is presented in a way which tugs at a user’s emotion, urging them to eat, drink, and be merry.</p>
<p>One particular night I can recall, my girlfriend was having a case of the “Mondays”. I was browsing on Instagram later that evening and came across Salut’s post about their Monday night $20 for smores and a drink special. It looked like a great idea to turn her day around and I told her we were going for a walk and surprised her with stopping at Salut.</p>
<p>That post resulted in, at the minimum, our $35 sale. No doubt we weren’t the only ones to have gone in that night because of that post either. It’s examples like this which perfectly showcase what can happen when a marketing team posts an image which perfectly mixes emotion, timeliness, content, and context.</p>

<h3 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h3><h4 id="What-is-LinkedIn"><a href="#What-is-LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="What is LinkedIn?"></a>What is LinkedIn?</h4><p>LinkedIn is perhaps one of the most underutilized social networks out there today. As one of the largest social networks the user base is immense. Thanks to it’s business focus, a brand doesn’t have to compete with funny cat videos or news of the latest big game. Still, most see it primarily as a professional networking site, not a place to showcase a business.</p>
<p>LinkedIn currently has over 300 million members in 200 countries[^fn-in#]. Originally, it was focused on helping users find jobs, and did a great job at facilitating networking. In recent years, it has expanded to focus more on news, as well as showcasing the businesses behind the employees. These sections all need to be looked at differently from a marketing standpoint.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-LinkedIn"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use LinkedIn?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use LinkedIn?</h4><p>First, one of the most overlooked resources that LinkedIn offers is the ability to post news articles. When a user logs on to LinkedIn, they first see a newsfeed with updates from their network, as well as news articles through LinkedIn’s news service, Pulse. Admist these, users can also spot articles shared by businesses and other users. By sharing articles which spotlight relevant articles with useful commentary, businesses can demonstrate their expertise in a field. This also serves to keep followers engaged with the company, as opposed to the company getting lost in the list of followers. Businesses should keep in mind that they should only share articles which are relevant and interesting. This is a professional network, not just a place to syndicate each blog post or company update. According to David Thacker, LinkedIn’s Vice President of Marketing Solutions Products, “Our users come to us in a professional context. They’re coming to see news, information, and insights that will help them be more successful in their careers. And a big part of that is getting content from companies.”[^fn-fco-link-brand]</p>
<p>The second umbrella topic for LinkedIn users to utilize when employing content marketing principles on LinkedIn is to utilize all the features made available to them. Just a handful are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Pages</strong> - LinkedIn allows a single business to showcase up to ten different brands. For example, Pepsi has a brand for both Pepsi and Pepsi Max. Both of these link back to Pepsi’s news, network, and career openings.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Messages</strong> - LinkedIn provides businesses with the ability to funnel messages to followers. This is part of their InMail messaging service.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - By creating or activly participating in groups, businesses can create a subnetwork of people interested in a specific topic or company. This also allows businesses to control the conversation by posting jobs, polls, and other status updates to a smaller group of interested followers.</li>
<li><strong>User Targeting</strong> - When posting status updates, LinkedIn allows businesses to select certain audience segments to show content to. This keeps the right content going to the right people, this being more relevant and engaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, LinkedIn does offer the ability for companies to post ads using a service called “Sponsored Posts”. Currently, LinkedIn only makes about 22% of their revenues from this service, so it’s not one of their most focused on revenue streams. It does offer a good opportunity to showcase a business tool or service though. When using this, businesses should keep in mind that users of LinkedIn come to the site to network and be in a professional environment, so ads for non-business related products are not well suited for this service.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="Case-Study-Deloitte"><a href="#Case-Study-Deloitte" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: Deloitte"></a>Case Study: Deloitte</h4><p>Deloitte is one of the best examples of a company effectively using LinkedIn for content marketing. Deloitte is a management consulting company which works on a multinational level across several different sectors. Their LinkedIn page speaks to this level of expertise perfectly.</p>
<p>To start, their page gives a good overview of their company and what they are about. Users can easily reach their country-specific Deloitte page, as well as seeing a featured link to Deloitte University Press, their in-house publishing department. Users can also easily find an active and up to date job board, showing that Deloitte’s social media staff is active in keeping things up to date.</p>
<p>Scrolling further down, Deloitte has a stream of recent news articles they have posted. There is a great mix of both shared content and in-house generated content, as well as several comments on each post to keep the conversation going. This section is key to Deloitte’s success on social media. Thanks to being able to share this news to their wide audience, they show that they are keeping up with daily news and trends. Their in-house content also speaks to the quality level of their consulting team, something most brands don’t think to implement on social media.</p>

<h3 id="Snapchat"><a href="#Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat"></a>Snapchat</h3><h4 id="What-is-Snapchat"><a href="#What-is-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="What is Snapchat?"></a>What is Snapchat?</h4><p>Snapchat is a quickly growing social network based around showing images which disappear after a number of seconds. Even though this technology has only been around a few years, it has walked quite the path towards finding relevancy. In it’s early years, it was seen as primarily a tool used be teenagers for sending photos which would not fare well in public, such as party photos or sexting. Quickly though, the addictiveness of quickly sending photos with a short message branched out into the platform catching on as an alternative to texting.</p>
<p>Recently, Snapchat has taken several steps to mature. Recent features introduced include the ability to have actual text conversations, as well as two which are very relevant towards businesses. First, Snapchat introduced “stories”, or a series of images by a certain user which show a series of images from the past 24 hours. This extends the traditional ephemeral messaging model Snapchat started with. The second innovation Snapchat recently released was the ability to link to a debit card and send money through the app. This feature is easy to do, just enter $xx to a person and the money will be sent.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Snapchat"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Snapchat?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Snapchat?</h4><p>Though it doesn’t have the ability to showcase a brand or have a strong presence, nor is it the most professional forum, Snapchat does boast a user base of 32.9% of millennials aged 18-34.[^fn-snap-usage] Businesses should go to where their customer is, and Snapchat is just that. The issue with focusing on Snapchat is this: there is not yet a public paid advertising service and discovery is tough. Much like Instagram, Snapchat is a very personal service and ads on there should reflect as much. As such, they are taking a very slow approach to opening up their advertising program. They only allow a handful of companies to show ads, and they do not prioritize them on a user’s feed. There also is the issue of discovery. Without hashtags or any sort of “sticky” messaging, it is tough for brands to create buzz on the network. Instead, they are limited to pushing stories to the people who voluntarily choose to follow them.</p>
<p>A second interesting aspect of Snapchat is that they are now allowing payments on the service. By linking to a debit card, users can easily send money to others. Though there are to tools for businesses to use this so far, it isn’t a stretch to see Snapchat turning into a sort of shopping or auction platform in the future. Payments would be effortless, with users being able to pay in a matter of just a few taps.</p>
<p>Snapchat is definitely still on the frontier of social networks, not something which most companies should focus on quite yet. It is something to keep an eye on though. Between it’s foray into money transfers and it’s fledgling advertising program, it could become the perfect service for reaching millennials.  </p>

<h4 id="Case-Study-NBA"><a href="#Case-Study-NBA" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: NBA"></a>Case Study: NBA</h4><p>Most of Snapchat’s successful marketing campaigns are not based around advertising, but instead generating buzz. One such example is the NBA. During the 2014 draft, the NBA posted a number of behind the scenes clips and photos to fans who follow the league. This generated a large amount of buzz and prompted more fans to tune in to the televised production. It also seems a very personal message, as opposed to an online ad for anyone to see.</p>

<h2 id="SEO-Recommendations"><a href="#SEO-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="SEO Recommendations"></a>SEO Recommendations</h2><p>Modern day SEO best practices are based around creating clean, semantic code. Unlike 5 or 10 years ago, when all that was needed was a few meta tags in the header to tell what the website is about, search engines factor in a variety of content to surface the most relevant sites while excluding spam.</p>
<p>Several factors go into this complicated formula for search engine placement. Most important is incorporating relevant content and keywords into the site. This keyword density is key for search engines to understand what a website is talking about or what industry and skill sets a business is experienced in. Also important is having other sites link back to your site. This is called cross-linking, which lends a site credibility with it’s peers.</p>
<p>Other best practices include having a mobile version of the site, enhancing page-load speed, serving pages over SSL, and having a well-structured, semantic site. All of these factors come together to show a search engine that a site is credible, informative, and user friendly.</p>
<p>One word of caution, there are commercial services which will create tons of links back to a site or vastly increase a follower count on social media. Though the short term gains of these sites are great, they can result in a site or account being banned or not surfaced to potential users. They should be avoided at all costs.</p>

        <h1 id="Issues-Surrounding-the-Regulation-of-Hydro-Fracking"><a href="#Issues-Surrounding-the-Regulation-of-Hydro-Fracking" class="headerlink" title="Issues Surrounding the Regulation of Hydro-Fracking"></a>Issues Surrounding the Regulation of Hydro-Fracking</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>As an issue which has been on the national spotlight for the past couple years, fracking is becoming a household name, often synonymous with corporate greed, health and environmental concerns, and a massive amount of legal battles. Amidst all this confusion, and causing some of it, is a concern regarding the lack of regulation on the practice of fracking. Why is such regulation being rallied for and what impact it will have on the mining process?</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Fracking"><a href="#What-Is-Fracking" class="headerlink" title="What Is Fracking?"></a>What Is Fracking?</h2><p>Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of natural gas mining which involves drilling horizontally through large shale deposits to reach pockets of gas which are not accessible through more traditional methods. To start the process, a drill bit goes several thousand feet deep into the earth. It is then directed in a horizontal direction as it reaches a shale formation, or “play”. As this shale is too hard to drill through, at this point a mixture of water and several other chemicals are injected into the earth in an attempt to cause fractures to radiate out from the drill bore.</p>
<p>After these fractures are made, the drilling crew then begins the flowback process. The flowback process involves relieving the pressure and allowing the water to rescind from the well, leaving behind a mixture of sand, gelatin, and chemicals. After the water leaves the site of the fractures, natural gas flows behind it and up the well to be transported and refined.</p>
<p>As for the recovered water, it is stored in large pits above ground until it is disposed of. Roughly 70% of this water can be reused in the fracking process (Maloney, 2012), but due to the high amount of salt brine, chemicals, and radionuclides, the remainder has to be disposed of through other methods. Some of this water is taken to municipal water treatment plants, where it can be turned into a safe water source. The remainder is taken to so-called “deep injection sites”, where it is injected into limestone or sandstone formations thousands of feet underground (EPA). The choice of disposal method is based on several factors, such as state regulations and economic viability. Oftentimes it is shipped to another state to be injected, as is often the case with wells in Pennsylvania (NPR).</p>
<h2 id="Controversy-Surrounding-Fracking"><a href="#Controversy-Surrounding-Fracking" class="headerlink" title="Controversy Surrounding Fracking"></a>Controversy Surrounding Fracking</h2><p>Due to the high impact fracking has on the environment, the high levels of toxicity in the water used when fracking, and several unknowns about the fracking process, the process is highly controversial. Not only that, but there have been several high profile cases in the news about negative health and environmental impacts of fracking, including cancer, methane leakage into drinking water, and earthquakes from the deep injection wells.</p>
<p>Despite these negatives, it is important to keep in mind that there are benefits to fracking, especially related to the economy. It has been estimated that in some areas affected by fracking, up to between 10,000 and 40,000 jobs are being created. Additionally, fracking causes less air pollution than many other methods of drilling for natural gas. Regulation doesn’t often come from the positives of an action though, and the remainder of this paper will explore the more controversial aspects of fracking and the damage it causes.</p>
<p>One major issue regarding fracking is the contamination of drinking water and aquifers near drill sites. In all actuality, there is only one known case of fracking itself affecting a drinking supply. (Several others may exist, but are not known to the public due to court settlements and NDAs (Urbina, 2011)). Instead, drinking water is contaminated due to toxic runoff from flowback containment pits and chemical spills. These sorts of cases are evidenced by incidents such as leaked fluid in Dimock, PA and Parachutte, CO, and drilling failure in Silt, CO.</p>
<p>A second major issue is that of seismic activity caused by the deep waste injection sites. There seems to be a heightened occurrence of seismic activity where these sites are located, presumably due to the injected fluid acting as a lubricating agent that allowed the normally stable faults to slip (Kansas Geological Survey, 2013). One such area that has been affected by these tectonic movements is Youngstown, OH. Located over the large Utica shale formation, there is a great deal of drilling activity taking place there. Of course, with that amount of drilling activity comes a large amount of wastewater being pumped into nearby sandstone formations. In December of 2011, both a 2.7 and 4.0 magnitude earthquake affected the region. Similar findings have been found in regions including Colorado and the Dallas / Ft. Worth area.</p>
<h2 id="Current-Regulation-Regarding-Fracking"><a href="#Current-Regulation-Regarding-Fracking" class="headerlink" title="Current Regulation Regarding Fracking"></a>Current Regulation Regarding Fracking</h2><p>Fracking has been going on for more than 40 years, but surprisingly there is still little regulation on the practice. In fact, under the Bush administration, fracking was allowed to become exempt from many laws. As the technique was not as commonly used at the time as it is today, and because it was not studied in a comprehensive manner, it was granted explicit exclusion from the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Air Act, and Clean Water Act thanks to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Bateman, 2010).</p>
<p>Thanks to the passage of this act, fracking operations are exempt from reporting what chemicals they are using, as well as not being required to monitor and report the usage of these chemicals as it relates to groundwater.</p>
<p>Outside of federal regulation, several states have additional regulation in place. In several states, including Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and others, companies are required to disclose the concentration of chemicals in each of their wells. This regulation does not extend to what the companies consider to be trade secrets though, limiting the effectiveness of these laws. In some cases, these laws extend so far as to prevent the release of trade secrets to physicians, even under an NDA.</p>
<h2 id="The-State-of-Increased-Regulation"><a href="#The-State-of-Increased-Regulation" class="headerlink" title="The State of Increased Regulation"></a>The State of Increased Regulation</h2><p>Although overall regulation is lax, several states are starting to create more comprehensive laws when it comes to fracking. New York is one such example, where wells are forbidden within 10 miles of municipal water structures. New York is also taking the lead on moratoriums till the results are better known. After the release of an upcoming EPA study (mentioned below), drilling operations must cease for 120 days after the report is released (Throupe et al., 2013).</p>
<p>On the federal level, fracking is being revisited by the EPA in a major study due out later this year. The study is attempting to find out if there is a relationship between fracking and the quality of ground and drinking water. As a major study, consisting of not only water quality readings, but also analysis of well construction and composition of the chemicals used for drilling, it will set the tone for drilling regulation for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>From a legislative perspective, prospects of additional legislation appear to be moving slowly. Take the FRAC act, for example. This proposed act would require oil and gas companies to disclose all chemicals used in their fracking operations. The act would alse restore the EPA’s authority to oversee fracking operations. It has been delayed several times though, and according to Govtrack, chances of it passing are dismal.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With all the publicity it is getting right now, there is no doubt that fracking is a major movement that is here to stay. When dealing with such large amounts of chemicals though, additional regulation is becoming increasingly necessary to protect against issues such as tainted water supplies and the causal of unwanted seismic activity. Currently legislation varies widely from state to state, and federal oversight is not only absent, but forbidden. For fracking to become a safe and economically viable energy source, additional research and additional regulation are needed.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="The-Role-of-Bitcoin-in-NGO-Funding"><a href="#The-Role-of-Bitcoin-in-NGO-Funding" class="headerlink" title="The Role of Bitcoin in NGO Funding"></a>The Role of Bitcoin in NGO Funding</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>The work currently being done by NGOs is incredibly important. At the same time, there is an inherent danger involved with the monetary transactions which fund the operations of these NGOs. From laundering operations to CIA cash drops, there a a variety of ways NGOs gain funding outside of private donations. As we become more wired and embrace new payment systems, Bitcoin may provide a viable option  for money transmissions in the future. What are the potential successes that could come from such a system? Likewise, what pitfalls may be experienced? This paper will attempt to describe what such a system would look like, as well as the pros and cons of using digital currency for NGO funding.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-Bitcoin"><a href="#What-is-a-Bitcoin" class="headerlink" title="What is a Bitcoin?"></a>What is a Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bitcoin is a rapidly expanding digital currency which has several traits making it a great way to transfer money between entities; overstepping national regulation and foreign borders. Boiled down to it’s basics, bitcoin is a currency based on cryptographic keys, each corresponding to a specific “block” of money. These “blocks” are stored in “wallets”, which are essentially digital bank accounts. The wallets are again just a set of cryptographic keys, eliminating third parties from being required to safeguard accounts.</p>
<p>Due to the technologies used in this currency, it is considered anonymous and nearly untraceable.  It was originally born from the need for a decentralized currency, removing third parties such as banks from the process of monetary transactions (Nakamoto, 2008). By separating transactions from identities, it is as anonymous and private as hard fiat currencies.</p>
<h2 id="Current-Issues-with-NGO-Funding"><a href="#Current-Issues-with-NGO-Funding" class="headerlink" title="Current Issues with NGO Funding"></a>Current Issues with NGO Funding</h2><p>In today’s political landscape, funding sources can create a significant effect on the success of an organization. This is of particular effect for NGOs operating in highly politicized countries such as Iran. Many groups which need to send aid to such countries lack the resources to effectively provide said aid. In a recent study, it was said that several Iranian NGOs were unable to function effectively due to “political stigmas” which prevented either (a) funding or (b) aid efforts (Bromideh, 2011). Other countries face issues with internal prosecution as well, such as humanitarian efforts in Sri Lanka. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), there is currently a large number of abuses against humans in refugee camps in the country. There is a cloak of silence on the issue though, as any citizens who speak out against the atrocities taking place may be placing themselves at risk of persecution and torture by the libertarian forces (The LTTE) (The Lancet, 2009).</p>
<p>There are additional problems related to funding for a much broader range of NGOs as well,  such as payment processing times. Though mainly a problem as it relates to quickly responding to large, catastrophic events, the time it takes to process typical bank donations can provide a hinderance to organizations, as well as making accountability to donors much tougher. Say, for example, someone sends $100 for tsunami aid. It takes a week to go from the credit card terminal to the bank account, another 3 days to perform an ACH or SEPA transfer to the overseas operation, and another portion of time to withdraw this money and put it to use. This makes the money unavailable in the moment, when it’s needed.</p>
<h2 id="How-Crypto-currency-can-Solve-Funding-Issues"><a href="#How-Crypto-currency-can-Solve-Funding-Issues" class="headerlink" title="How Crypto-currency can Solve Funding Issues"></a>How Crypto-currency can Solve Funding Issues</h2><p>Using crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin might very well be a strong solution to enable the flow of money in a quicker and more anonymous manner. Due to the lack of necessity to involve third party organizations such as national banks, Bitcoin is able to be used wherever internet access can be had. In fact, some NGOs are already starting to use the digital currency to further their efforts. Take the Sri Lanka Campaign for example; they are quoted as saying that many citizens decide not to donate to the campaign because of fear from military repercussions. This is a major issue because even if Sri Lankan citizens wish to donate to the cause, it is not worth the risk of persecution. If you go to their website now though, they recently started providing a Bitcoin wallet address for people to anonymously send funds to. Not only does this create anonymity for transactions from Sri Lankan citizens, accepting bitcoin also enables donations from anywhere in the world and processes transactions in a matter of seconds or minutes, not days or weeks. They are the perfect use case of how a NGO could effectively use digital currency to ease funding issues produced by intrusion upon human rights.</p>
<p>The Sri Lanka Campaign is not the only NGO accepting digital currency at this time either; the Bitcoin wiki lists close to 100 charities which currently accept Bitcoin, including at least three NGOs. One such example is Eudemocracia, which seeks to enhance democracy through technology. Through providing their software to groups in Argentina, including the city of Buenos Aires, they are seeking to open the government to create a more democratic approach. By accepting Bitcoin, it helps to speed transaction times and increase donations from outside the area they are helping. Recently, they also say they have been promoting the use of the currency in stores and markets within Buenos Aires, bypassing the high artificial inflation rates which exist within Sri Lanka (The Economist, 2011).</p>
<h2 id="Issues-Surrounding-Adoption"><a href="#Issues-Surrounding-Adoption" class="headerlink" title="Issues Surrounding Adoption"></a>Issues Surrounding Adoption</h2><p>On of the biggest issues with making the transition to crypto-currencies is the usability of the technology for anything more than as a money-transfer protocol. One reason for this is the lack of technology which exists in some countries. Especially in rural areas, smartphones are not common and it’s not feasible to purchase goods and services with bitcoin. There are companies working to enable the use of bitcoin on “dumb” phones, as well as paper wallets, but in the near term, bitcoin makes sense primarily as a money transfer protocol as opposed to a system to store funds long-term (allAfrica.com, 2013).</p>
<p>Other issues which make bitcoin unsuitable for long-term storage of funds is the volatility of the currency at present. From one day to the next, the BTC/USD exchange rate can fluctuate hugely, even by 15% or more. Because of this instability of valuation for bitcoin, funds need to be withdrawn quickly to avoid monetary losses. There are services which help to provide this functionality though, such as BitPay. This does eliminate some of the benefits which exist from the acceptance of Bitcoin though, especially as it relates to the speed of processing donations. Having to convert back to a hard fiat currency can take several days (though this is still less time consuming than accepting credit card donations online).</p>
<p>One final major issue to watch for is the security of the coins, primarily storage methods. If coins are to be put in long term storage, they should be stored in a secure “wallet”, offline or on paper. Though the technical knowledge to do so is not very limiting, it is an additional step for the financiers to consider. The security aspect is important because when stored in a wallet with a third party or exchange, there exists a potential for theft, damage, or loss. In fact, this was recently exhibited during the Mt. Gox debacle in early 2014, which led to the loss of several hundred million dollars worth of bitcoin which were kept in Mt. Gox’s wallets.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is well established that NGOs provide good to the citizens of where they are trying to make a difference. At the same time, they face a variety of challenges, with funding being one of the largest. New technologies may be able to provide a solution though, and using bitcoin as a money transfer protocol is something which can already be put in place to provide more security and privacy to donors. At the same time, there are risks to watch out for. One must be careful to adhere to strong security practices and not overstep the regulatory issues of one’s country. One must also be prepared to combat volatility in the exchange rate and have a system in place for withdrawing money. In any case, it is certainly a feasible solution, especially for NGOs affected by fears of human rights abuse, but as with any emerging technology, there are a few hiccups to iron out before it goes mainstream.</p>

        <h1 id="The-Effectiveness-of-the-Occupy-Wall-Street-Movement"><a href="#The-Effectiveness-of-the-Occupy-Wall-Street-Movement" class="headerlink" title="The Effectiveness of the Occupy Wall Street Movement"></a>The Effectiveness of the Occupy Wall Street Movement</h1><p>Occupy Wall Street is going to become a massive political issue in the coming months. There’s no doubt that there are currently tens of thousands of people all around the nation, and the globe, who want to make their voice heard about the inequality of wealth… and they are succeeding in getting noticed. The question is, how effective is Occupy Wall Street? In it’s current form, Occupy Wall Street has potential, but it lacks the leadership, unity, and direction that will allow it to succeed in the long term.</p>
<p>Basically, Occupy Wall Street is a movement which is attempting to provide a political and economic voice for the 99% of people who aren’t currently holding the top 40% of the wealth in the United States of America. It started in New York City on the seventeenth of September of 2011 and it’s initial purpose  was to protest corporate greed by the upper 1 percent of people in America (Scherer). Since then, Occupy Wall Street has grown to encompass all sorts of political and economic issues affecting the commonfolk of the United States. Issues such as subsidies for big business, high fees imposed by the major financial institutions, and the pervasiveness of lobbying in our nation’s capital have also taken center stage in the Occupy Wall Street Movement. By the 10th of October, Occupy Wall Street had really begun to take off around the nation and in some of the other major cities around the globe. With this came fragmentation and/or expansions of the initially stated goals of the movement. For example, in Oakland, California, protesters are stating local school closures, waning union benefits and cuts to social services as additional reasons why they are protesting (MSNBC).</p>
<p>Although Occupy Wall Street is powerful movement that’s taken the world by storm, it doesn’t have an actual leader, or even a collective of people with leadership roles. Started by a small number of extreme liberals and social disruptors at the request of Adbusters, an anti-consumerist magazine, the movement has been a leaderless movement from the very beginning (according to the Occupy Wall Street website). This can create some very interesting challenges to those who are participating in the Occupy movement. For starters, without any central leadership, various Occupy Wall Street movements don’t always have similar goals. In some areas, protesters may be marching for a lack of school funding. In others, they may be marching to protest bank fees; and in some areas they may be marching to protest consumerism. Without leadership, there is no central, definable message or clearly defined goals that can be referenced to determine what protesters want. The downsides to this are many, and have the possibility of completely derailing the movement. For example, if one faction of Occupy Wall Street were to start protesting something that the other offshoots of the movements didn’t agree with, it could cause a schism within the group which could cause many people to leave. Another potential downside to not having a central message is that some people could start doing activities which wasn’t in line with what the core of the movement believed, but still giving the entire movement a bad name. For example, when “Occupy Oakland” blocked off a shipping port in October of 2011, there were a few people who decided to cause vandalism to area businesses. Even though the majority of the group stressed peaceful protest techniques, some of the public could have misinterpreted the violent actions of a few to be representative of the whole.</p>
<p>Another issue stemming up from the lack of leadership is the absence of a central figure representing the movement. Throughout history, almost all major movements have had a leader who is able to communicate to and negotiate with governments, businesses, and the media. Take for instance the civil rights movement; leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X led their own movements and as such served as a spokesperson for their entire following. Even modern, seemingly leaderless movements typically need a handful of core leaders to guide the actions of the many. For example, in Egypt, it was the leaders of the Rebel forces who decided how to go about overthrowing the existing regime. Based on both history and the events which have taken place as part of Occupy Wall Street, the Occupy protesters will be hard pressed to communicate a focused, highly effective agenda without a strong, central leadership.</p>
<p>Even without centralized leadership, there is still hope for Occupy Wall Street. Thanks to modern media, social networking, and some of the ideas employed at protests in the Middle East and India, there is still hope for the Occupy Wall Street Movement. In recent years. the media has been on of the strongest platforms for change. Take for instance the uprisings in Iran a few years ago. Because of Twitter, masses of people had an easy way to get the word out about their campaign and the oppression that they were under. Another example is the “Arab Spring” movements which took place in the spring of 2011. Facebook and Twitter allowed for the organization of masses of people so that they were able to organize a protest against oppressive governments in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other nations. A collective of social media users were able to make their voices heard and their opinions known. They organized peaceful protests, marches, and rallies. Eventually, they were successful in overthrowing their governments and creating change. According to a professor at UW who is researching the effects of social media on social movements, social networks such as Twitter play a pivotal role uprisings because they often catch the older, non-technical leadership by surprise. (Casey). Just like Arab nations were able to leverage social media to overthrow entire governments, Occupy Wall Street actually has a chance because of their presence on these sites. The protesters used YouTube to show examples of police brutality, they used Twitter to organize their masses, and they used Facebook to draw support from the public. Occupy Wall Street is using the same tactics. Thanks to social media, protesters got the word out about police brutality and possible infringements on their first amendment rights (the entrapment on the Brooklyn Bridge, brutality in the Oakland protests, etc). Even though it wasn’t until the mainstream media started showing the video caught by the protesters that the majority of Americans heard about the protests, that wouldn’t have been possible without the citizen reporters who were part of the throng of protesters.[FS㓀ఞ㓀뿿1]  Since this footage is available to anyone online, it has the potential to expand all through the world, from Europe to Africa. The usage of social media in the Occupy Wall Street campaign brings a new precedent to the famous phrase, “The whole world is watching.” Social media is also used for planning events though, not just reporting on them. Through Facebook events and blog posts, protesters are able to create events to take place in various cities. The public is able to easily find others who want to support a movement just by typing in a keyword such as “Occupy Akron”. This pulls up a list of all events which are held in Akron with their dates and times. This allows anyone to be informed about how to participate. Thanks to social media, anyone is able to join in with the hive of activity which surrounds the Occupy Wall Street protests. The other great thing about being able to address so many people at once is that movements can take place all around the world at one time, helping to speed up change. In comparison to other social movements, like the Progressive Era, which took roughly 20 years to bring about social change, there is a possibility for Occupy Wall Street’s push for social change to take place in a very small amount of time.</p>
<p>So far, the Occupy Wall Street movement has had a huge success as far as getting the word out about their grievances and telling people about their movement, but the political impact hasn’t been near as successful. Despite being acknowledged by some of the world’s most powerful leaders, for example, President Obama, they are still short of gaining their public support. Even though congress has recognized that the protesters are dissatisfied with the way things are, many of the leaders are dismissing the movement as a small faction of the public with extremist views. In the past, most movements have only gained success by infiltrating the halls of our capitol. Take for instance the civil rights protests. Leaders were able to present their views to congress and negotiate with leaders for legislation giving them what they were demanding. There are more recent examples of movements enacting change through establishing a position in congress. When the Tea Party first started, most of the public dismissed them as a meaningless cause that would fizzle out; once they gained seats in congress though, they were able to have a strong impact on politics. Because the Occupy Wall Street protesters haven’t yet come up with a method of making their voices heard in politics, whether by talking to our nation’s leaders, or by establishing a position as one of our nation’s leaders, it’s lacking the voice needed to make it a successful movement.</p>
<p>There is a potential for great political and economic change to happen in the coming weeks and months. There is a huge movement, growing in size daily, that doesn’t show any signs of slowing down or letting up. The protesters of Occupy Wall Street have yet to come up with an actual plan though. They don’t have a shared list of grievances and goals. They haven’t yet found a way to make their voices heard by our nation’s leaders. Above all, they don’t currently have a method of leadership which will allow their protest to be powerful and adaptable to anything that comes in their way. The movement hasn’t yet utilized their full power and influence, and as such, isn’t yet near as powerful or effective as it has the potential to be.</p>

        <p>The Gatorade G-Series commercials have attempted to set out a new course for the brand. There are several reasons why this is the case, which will be explored in more detail in the following paragraphs. My basic conclusion is that by appealing to the current generation’s emotion towards sport, nutrition, and quest to always find the next great thing, the Gatorade G-Series advertisement effectively communicates a message to it’s viewers, even while abandoning all trace of fact. There are several reasons why this is possible, including the demographic targeted by the commercial, the star power within the ad, and existing acceptance of Gatorade’s product.</p>
<p>The latest commercial for G-Series (Gatorade has Evolved) starts with a series of scenes set back in the mid 20th century showing athletes who used water to hydrate before and during sporting events. As it goes through the numerous scenes, the ad also flashes several messages across the screen which serve to show examples of evolution in sports. Some examples of these messages are that basketball used to be played with peach baskets and that tennis rackets used to be wooden. The entire commercial is set to the soundtrack of “Evolve” which was sung Kevin Quinn and produced by David Banner. The song is modeled after the traditional gospel music which was often played and enjoyed during the 1950’s and early 60’s, when the first version of Gatorade was released, while also sneaking in a hip-hop feel to the song in order to influence the younger generation.</p>
<p>This first section of the commercial sets up the emotional plays for the rest of the commercial. This is done through the introduction of nostalgia. The black and white imagery paired with the 1950’s era music instantly captures the attention of anyone with a knowledge of sports. Heralded by many as one of the golden eras of sports, the 1950’s and 60’s were a time of great accomplishments. Olympic records were broken several times by Team USA, a number of baseball records were made, and African Americans and women were becoming accepted as serious athletic contenders. Along with these events, many movies, like “Rocky” and “Remember the Titans” were set during this era (these movies helped to associate a nostalgic link between sports and the mid-20th century). By using 50’s style music combined with black and white imagery, Gatorade instantly draws in those with a great attraction to sports culture and history through the use of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Building off of nostalgia which was already introduced, the second part of the commercial associates Gatorade with the evolution of sports. About two-thirds of the way into the ad, it says that hydration used to be water. At this point, the ad displays the message “In 1964, we started a revolution” and the ad switches from black and white imagery to color while showing a series of athletes drinking Gatorade. The music also switches from instrumentals to vocals which declare that “If you want a revolution, you have to evolve”. This is followed by a series of clips showing some great athletic moments of the past four decades. By associating Gatorade with athletic superstars such as Michael Jordan, Serena Williams, Mike Tyson, and Mia Hamm, the ad has managed to both remind the viewing audience of those sports accomplishments which happened while the athletes were using Gatorade and to also include a large number of endorsements by some of the greatest athletes of all time since the views make a connection between the great athletes and the use of Gatorade.</p>
<p>The second third of the commercial also utilizes a great deal of pathos outside of nalstalgia. By showing clips of athletes such as Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, and Serena Williams, along with images of athletes drinking Gatorade and the celebratory tradition of Gatorade being dumped over a coach’s head after a win, the ad continues to hold the attention of sports enthusiasts. This is because the intended audience (teenage and young adult athletes) of the ad either remembers the great moments shown in the ad or recognizes the greatness shown, or at the very least is able to relate to them in some way through involvement in their own athletic endeavors and accomplishments.</p>
<p>In the final third of the commercial, the actual product is introduced. Gatorade quickly introduces their concept of “Prime, Perform, and Recover”, a three part system consisting of carbohydrates to prepare for an athletic event, traditional Gatorade to hydrate during an athletic event, and protein, to help an athlete recover from a grueling athletic performance. This message is intermixed with more imagery of great sports moments, although now the video clips look brighter, clearer, and more vivid then in the middle section of the video. All the while, the continuation of the catchy 1950’s music combined with the fast pace of the commercial manages to keep the audience’s interest piqued and the nostalgia flowing.</p>
<p>The main emotional tactic used in the commercial seems to be the use of nostalgia. There are several reasons why nostalgia is a great marketing tool. According to Steve Elliot, a journalist for the New York Times, “Nostalgia is a critical component of pitches from sponsors” (Elliot, 2010). A handful of studies have been done about nostalgia as well, and it was found that nostalgia has the effect of invoking personal thoughts in a reader of an article much better than other forms of advertising (Strenge). In the case of Gatorade, the pairing of nostalgia in sports may be an even stronger pairing than most other commercials which use the principles of nostalgia. For the viewer, watching the Gatorade commercial conjures memories of not only great sports accomplishments, but also establishes a personal tie to the message since the viewer may be reminded of their own great athletic accomplishments, the camaraderie of being on a sports team, or their childhood dream of being a great sports superstar.</p>
<p>Even though the commercial is based around the evolution of a product and an emotional, nostalgic message, there are several other reasons why the G Series commercial is a great commercial. One such reason is because of how well it relates to it’s target demographic. Gatorade is trying to reach two groups of audiences. The first being high school athletes aged 13-17 and the second being highly athletic young adults aged 16-24 (Zmuda, 2010). The marketing message is so well targeted to these audiences that I would actually be led to believe that someone who doesn’t fit into Gatorade’s target group of dedicated athletes wouldn’t feel even the slightest motivation to purchase any of the components of the G-Series of products. For the intended audience though, the use of great moments in sports paired with the emotion brought about by the upbeat music and action-packed video is a powerful tool for encouraging athletes to try the new products.</p>
<p>One final reason why the Gatorade G-Series ad was so successful was because of the existing brand recognition that Gatorade has with athletes. As opposed to the various other sporting drinks such CarboRocket, Vitamin Water, or even Powerade, Gatorade has a much larger market share. They also have much better consumer recognition and customer loyalty (Gatorade has 4,178,379 “likes” on Facebook as opposed to Powerade’s 187,629). With this recognition though, comes another way to skirt around including any factual evidence backing Gatorade’s claims of  enhancing sports performance in the commercial. Because of their emotional link to Gatorade’s products, athletes will be anxious to try the new products made by the brand they already know and love, even if nothing besides the name has really changed.</p>
<p>Despite being highly effective, the prolific use of emotion the the G Series commercial does have some downsides though. In the commercial, one can see that there is absolutely no factual evidence to Gatorade’s argument that the G-Series will help an athlete to perform longer, faster, and stronger. The only information about the product is that it consists of three products, for use before, during, and after an athletic performance. This in itself can prove confusing to some people that Gatorade is trying to reach with it’s ads. For one, it seems as though the new branding leaves behind the massive market a pre-teens and teenagers who drink Gatorade as an everyday beverage as opposed to a sports drink. Additionally, in a survey of several 19-20 year old athletes, Gatorade was sending a message which brought about mixed signals about the new products. On one hand, athletes appreciated the new products which Gatorade came out with (the prime and the protein), but on the other hand, these athletes were worried that the traditional Gatorade formula would be changed from what they were used to and trusted (Lippert, 2010). Facts which further explain and back up what Gatorade is trying to sell, namely the two new products which complement the traditional Gatorade, would certainly go a long way towards helping explain the new products to viewers and potential customers.</p>
<p>As you can see, even without any consideration being given to fact, Gatorade has created a advertising masterpiece by playing off of the emotions of the people which watch their ads for their G-Series products. The advertisements for G-Series will effectively launch Gatorade into a whole new era.</p>

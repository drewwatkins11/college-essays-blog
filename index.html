Today, anyone with internet access has a voice, and this makes it more challenging for businesses to connect with and be heard by customers as they are bombarded with so much information.</p></div><div class="post-meta"></div></div></div><div class="post-entry"><div class="post-time">2014-04-27</div><div class="post-desc"><div class="post-title"><a href="/college-essays-blog/2014/04/27/fracking/">Issues Surrounding the Regulation of Hydro-Fracking</a></div><div class="post-content"><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>As an issue which has been on the national spotlight for the past couple years, fracking is becoming a household name, often synonymous with corporate greed, health and environmental concerns, and a massive amount of legal battles. Amidst all this confusion, and causing some of it, is a concern regarding the lack of regulation on the practice of fracking. Why is such regulation being rallied for and what impact it will have on the mining process?</p></div><div class="post-meta"></div></div></div><div class="post-entry"><div class="post-time">2014-02-27</div><div class="post-desc"><div class="post-title"><a href="/college-essays-blog/2014/02/27/bitcoin-funding/">The Role of Bitcoin in NGO Funding</a></div><div class="post-content"><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>The work currently being done by NGOs is incredibly important. At the same time, there is an inherent danger involved with the monetary transactions which fund the operations of these NGOs. From laundering operations to CIA cash drops, there a a variety of ways NGOs gain funding outside of private donations. As we become more wired and embrace new payment systems, Bitcoin may provide a viable option  for money transmissions in the future. What are the potential successes that could come from such a system? Likewise, what pitfalls may be experienced? This paper will attempt to describe what such a system would look like, as well as the pros and cons of using digital currency for NGO funding.</p></div><div class="post-meta"></div></div></div><div class="post-entry"><div class="post-time">2011-12-04</div><div class="post-desc"><div class="post-title"><a href="/college-essays-blog/2011/12/04/wall-street/">The Effectiveness of the Occupy Wall Street Movement</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>Occupy Wall Street is going to become a massive political issue in the coming months. There’s no doubt that there are currently tens of thousands of people all around the nation, and the globe, who want to make their voice heard about the inequality of wealth… and they are succeeding in getting noticed. The question is, how effective is Occupy Wall Street? In it’s current form, Occupy Wall Street has potential, but it lacks the leadership, unity, and direction that will allow it to succeed in the long term.</p></div><div class="post-meta"></div></div></div><div class="post-entry"><div class="post-time">2011-10-04</div><div class="post-desc"><div class="post-title"><a href="/college-essays-blog/2011/10/04/g-rhetoric/">The Rhetoric of &quot;G&quot;</a></div><div class="post-content"><p>The Gatorade G-Series commercials have attempted to set out a new course for the brand. There are several reasons why this is the case, which will be explored in more detail in the following paragraphs. My basic conclusion is that by appealing to the current generation’s emotion towards sport, nutrition, and quest to always find the next great thing, the Gatorade G-Series advertisement effectively communicates a message to it’s viewers, even while abandoning all trace of fact. There are several reasons why this is possible, including the demographic targeted by the commercial, the star power within the ad, and existing acceptance of Gatorade’s product.</p></div><div class="post-meta"></div></div></div></div></article><div class="container page-navigator-wrapper"></div><footer id="footer"><div class="container"><div class="bar"><div class="social"><a href="/atom.xml" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-rss"></i></a></div><div class="footer">© 2017 <a href="/" rel="nofollow">Drew Watkins</a>.

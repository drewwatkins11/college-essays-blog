<h2 id="Basics-of-Social-Media"><a href="#Basics-of-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Basics of Social Media"></a>Basics of Social Media</h2><p>As the world transitions to a more web-based, information-rich, interaction model, the ways companies need to communicate with their potential customers will have to change. Today, anyone with internet access has a voice, and this makes it more challenging for businesses to connect with and be heard by customers as they are bombarded with so much information.</p>
<p>As part of this adaptation, content marketing is becoming more valuable that traditional sales techniques.[^fn_1] The ability to create a story around a brand or product, capture followers for that story, and convert them into loyal customers can have far greater effects than sending a postcard or taking out an ad in the paper ever could. It is important to keep in mind that even though there are many products out there which allow businesses to push ads to consumers, campaigns which do not create engagement or loyalty will underperform.</p>
<p>It is also important to apply this strategy of content marketing to online tools. Though it is incredibly easy to take out an ad on Facebook, one must be careful to create value in these ads. Though advertising a product will bring about a sale, it will not make for a loyal customer. According to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3009543/dialed/a-top-linkedin-exec-on-why-content-marketing-matters-more-than-ever" target="_blank" rel="external">Fast Company</a>, there are several tips which can help a business to create content.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Prioritize Value</li>
<li>Keep Your Audience Interested</li>
<li>Be Human</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Prioritizing value above the sale is perhaps the most important point to consider. Going back to creating content over advertising, when a customer sees content which adds value, it helps to gain a follow, and in turn, a customer. One can add value through many methods, including engaging the customer, publishing content with respect to timeliness[^fn_2], and providing context relevant to the user.[^fn_3]</p>
<p>The second major point is keeping your audience interested. When the audience is not interested in the item, they are likely to ignore the ad, or even take measures to block your social media account for appearing again. Methods of keeping the audience interested go back to not only creating value, but also targeting a specific demographic to see your ad. This keeps one’s valuable advertising dollars from being wasted on a demographic which doesn’t even care. It’s encouraged to get as granular as necessary when creating targeted ads.</p>
<p>Finally, a company should try to be human in their ad campaigns. Humor, commentary, and light banter (related to the brand, of course) can all go a long ways towards establishing trust and credibility with a user.</p>
<h2 id="Overview-of-Social-Media-Platforms"><a href="#Overview-of-Social-Media-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Overview of Social Media Platforms"></a>Overview of Social Media Platforms</h2><h3 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h3><h4 id="What-is-Facebook"><a href="#What-is-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="What is Facebook?"></a>What is Facebook?</h4><p>As one of the original and most commonly used social networks, Facebook also has one of the strongest fanbases for entrepreneurs to target. Currently, Facebook has roughly 1.23 billion users worldwide, which is an absolutely astronomical number. In fact, it is higher than the entire developed world population (1.2 billion in 2003, according to the <a href="http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2013/2013-world-population-data-sheet.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">Population Reference Bureau</a>).</p>
<p>Started in 2004, Facebook was originally just a place to share updates between college students. As it grew, it reached more and more people, till it opened it’s doors to all and the flood of users started using the network. As more users began to use the site, it also allowed businesses to create specific pages to showcase their brand. Along with this came advertising.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook offers a large stable of products, including Facebook for both desktop and mobile, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Among these products are also a slew of marketing opportunities for brands to take part in.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Facebook"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Facebook?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Facebook?</h4><p>One of the original ways to monetize on Facebook was through the use of advertising in the sidebar. Much like Google Adwords, these ads are based on an auction system. Depending on the number of ads available for a given space and the amount of money budgeted for these ads, advertisers are given a price either per thousand impressions or per click. Facebook is constantly redesigning it’s site though, and the trend has been towards increasing ad real estate while increasing ad size. This has resulted 25% less ads per page while causing the average price of an ad to increase by 123%[^fn-fb-usage].</p>
<p>Perhaps a better option for Facebook pages is to publish updates which go directly to users’ newsfeeds by publishing content to their page. Much like personal users can post updates to their timelines, Facebook business users can also post these sorts of updates. Though without the paid advertising, the reach won’t be as high, by publishing engaging content, it can help a business reach a large audience of it’s followers. Businesses on Facebook can also pay to promote these posts in user’s newsfeeds, much like how they are able to run ads.</p>
<p>Across Facebook, the principles of content advertising apply more than they ever have in the past. In fact, recently Facebook created a “zero organic reach” policy for overly promotional posts. Essentially, Facebook users can’t run ads without paying for an actual ad. In all actuality, there is research that Facebook marketers should have been avoiding these sorts of ads from the start. According to PageLever, a third-party Facebook analytics service, 1 in 50 posts are hidden or given some sort of negative feedback by users[^fn-fb-hide]. In these cases, page fans actually will elect to hide all posts from a page or report it as spam much more than hiding that one particuar post. By utilizing the principles of content marketing as opposed to just posting ads, Facebook marketers can ensure success and a wide reach on this increasing growing social network.</p>

<h4 id="Case-Study-Ford-Trucks"><a href="#Case-Study-Ford-Trucks" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: Ford Trucks"></a>Case Study: Ford Trucks</h4><p>Ford has a very strong content marketing strategy across it’s brands. One of it’s most engaging is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fordtrucks" target="_blank" rel="external">Ford Trucks</a>. As America’s top selling vehicle for 32 years and the top truck for 43, the brand has a huge number of loyal followers. As Ford knows the success of it’s brand is based upon these loyal customers, it focuses on engaging them, not selling ads. Ford’s content strategy is to show a selection of videos, product news, and behind-the-scenes content. Where Ford Trucks really excels though, is in it’s fan engagement. Through posting photos of fan’s trucks, creating video content based around fan challenges, and maintaining an open communication network with fans, Ford Trucks exemplifies what it takes to take a content-first approach to marketing on social media.</p>

<h3 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h3><h4 id="What-is-Twitter"><a href="#What-is-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="What is Twitter?"></a>What is Twitter?</h4><p>With 284 million monthly active users, Twitter is one of the largest social networks out there behind Facebook. As opposed to image-based or post-based social networks, Twitter is based around the act of sending 140 character “tweets”. The upside to this limit is that Twitter is very much a tool for updates, news, and conversations, as opposed to static content.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Twitter"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Twitter?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Twitter?</h4><p>Like most social networks, Twitter allows for users to publish ads which appear right in a user’s newsfeed. Twitter also allows large brands to pay to have a certain topic trend in front of millions of users.</p>
<p>The real story of how Twitter is useful to small businesses is it’s focus on conversation. Nowadays, Twitter is used as a support tool and recommendation engine. Users expect a near-immediate reply when tweeting to a company’s social media account and want to have authentic conversation with companies. In addition, because of the huge reach that a tweet has, it has the potential to make or destroy a brand. For example, when a user tweeted a photo of an 11 inch Subway footlong, it caused a massive uproar and created a lot of negative publicity for Subway.</p>
<p>Additionally, Twitter uses hashtags to help categorize content. Many brands have created a trend of using hashtags to gain free publicity through the use of hashtags representing the brand. For example</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="Case-Study-Newcastle-Brown-Ale-Newcastle"><a href="#Case-Study-Newcastle-Brown-Ale-Newcastle" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: Newcastle Brown Ale (@Newcastle)"></a>Case Study: Newcastle Brown Ale (<a href="https://twitter.com/Newcastle" target="_blank" rel="external">@Newcastle</a>)</h4><p>Newcastle Brown Ale has taken a creative approach to online advertising and content marketing by creating a campaign based around the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoBollocks" target="_blank" rel="external">#NoBollocks</a>. Their content actually has very little to do with their beers, but instead is based around time-wasting and sarcastic, but hilarious content. They also employ strategies such as massive fan giveaways, such as one campaign where they gave out 50,000 $1 checks for following them. Throughout all this content strategy, Newcastle gets their brand out there and get people curious about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><h4 id="What-is-Instagram"><a href="#What-is-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="What is Instagram?"></a>What is Instagram?</h4><p>Based primarily around telling stories through photos as opposed to text, Instagram has quickly grown into one of the most popular social networks out there. That said, the culture of Instagram is very personal and private. They do not have a public advertising program and are still more focused on curating content than monetization at this point.</p>
<p>The primary method of gaining followers on the network is through word of mouth and following brands a user is loyal towards. Though this is a roadblock to quickly reaching a large number of followers, the followers a business does gain are likely to engage with content and be more loyal than followers on other platforms.</p>
<p>Another key compenent of Instagram is the use of hashtags. Used the same way as they are on Twitter, hashtags allow a user to quickly see a certain category of content from across accounts. Additionally, there has been a sort of tradition that has popped up through Twitter’s hashtags, for example, #tbt for Throwback Thursday. These represent great opportunities for brands to appear human to users.</p>
<p>Recently, Instagram has started exploring paid advertising through the use of “Sponsored Posts”. These are images which are placed in a user’s newsfeed from businesses which the user does not follow. The trick to this is not invading a user’s privacy or sense of community, and is currently in the alpha stages of a full scale rollout, with only about 10 brands invited to use it. For now, the option is not available to small businesses or the public.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Instagram"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Instagram?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Instagram?</h4><p>Instagram is perhaps the most curated social network out there, and despite it’s size, users are protective of the exclusivity awarded to them by the simple feed and only seeing users they wish to look at. This culture, combined with the fact that sponsored posts are currently only available to a very small number of users, forces customers to prioritze content above all.</p>
<p>According to Instagram’s <a href="[http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/76235731349/tools-and-tips-to-help-marketers-inspire-and]">business site</a>, there are several tips a small business can use when beginning to market on the platform:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be True to Your Brand</strong> - Photos should be representative of one’s brand, not just simple text or a generic image.</li>
<li><strong>Share Experiences</strong> - Show the adventure or emotion which comes with using a brand. What does a photo evoke in a user?</li>
<li><strong>Find Beauty Everywhere</strong> - Even industrial machines or a muddy field can be made into a beatiful image. Look at the world through a creative lens.</li>
<li><strong>Inspire Action</strong> - Use hashtags to allow users to create their own content and give your brand momentum. For example, how <a href="[[http://instagram.com/nike]">@Nike’s</a> hashtag, <a href="[http://iconosquare.com/tag/justdoit]">#justdoit</a>, caught on.</li>
<li><strong>Know Your Audience</strong> - If your audience is comprised of foodies, or of sports fans, or of families, your content should reflect that. Know your audience and cater to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like many social media sites, before joining Instagram, a business should be ready for the commitment. Instagram is a very personal platform, and businesses should be wary of what that may involve. Additionally, Instagram is a simple phone app and doesn’t offer any sort of insights or metrics to gain feedback about ROI or engagement. What businesses see is what everyone sees.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="Case-Study-salutkitchenbar"><a href="#Case-Study-salutkitchenbar" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: @salutkitchenbar"></a>Case Study: @salutkitchenbar</h4><p>There are many successful examples of businesses marketing through Instagram. Some notable examples include Southwest Airlines, Deschutes Brewery, and TSA. One that particularly stands out from experience though is a small wine bar in Tempe. Salut Kitchen Bar is a trendy, urban, wine bar in a college town. As such, it naturally turned to Instagram to reach it’s target market. Each photo is presented in a way which tugs at a user’s emotion, urging them to eat, drink, and be merry.</p>
<p>One particular night I can recall, my girlfriend was having a case of the “Mondays”. I was browsing on Instagram later that evening and came across Salut’s post about their Monday night $20 for smores and a drink special. It looked like a great idea to turn her day around and I told her we were going for a walk and surprised her with stopping at Salut.</p>
<p>That post resulted in, at the minimum, our $35 sale. No doubt we weren’t the only ones to have gone in that night because of that post either. It’s examples like this which perfectly showcase what can happen when a marketing team posts an image which perfectly mixes emotion, timeliness, content, and context.</p>

<h3 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h3><h4 id="What-is-LinkedIn"><a href="#What-is-LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="What is LinkedIn?"></a>What is LinkedIn?</h4><p>LinkedIn is perhaps one of the most underutilized social networks out there today. As one of the largest social networks the user base is immense. Thanks to it’s business focus, a brand doesn’t have to compete with funny cat videos or news of the latest big game. Still, most see it primarily as a professional networking site, not a place to showcase a business.</p>
<p>LinkedIn currently has over 300 million members in 200 countries[^fn-in#]. Originally, it was focused on helping users find jobs, and did a great job at facilitating networking. In recent years, it has expanded to focus more on news, as well as showcasing the businesses behind the employees. These sections all need to be looked at differently from a marketing standpoint.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-LinkedIn"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use LinkedIn?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use LinkedIn?</h4><p>First, one of the most overlooked resources that LinkedIn offers is the ability to post news articles. When a user logs on to LinkedIn, they first see a newsfeed with updates from their network, as well as news articles through LinkedIn’s news service, Pulse. Admist these, users can also spot articles shared by businesses and other users. By sharing articles which spotlight relevant articles with useful commentary, businesses can demonstrate their expertise in a field. This also serves to keep followers engaged with the company, as opposed to the company getting lost in the list of followers. Businesses should keep in mind that they should only share articles which are relevant and interesting. This is a professional network, not just a place to syndicate each blog post or company update. According to David Thacker, LinkedIn’s Vice President of Marketing Solutions Products, “Our users come to us in a professional context. They’re coming to see news, information, and insights that will help them be more successful in their careers. And a big part of that is getting content from companies.”[^fn-fco-link-brand]</p>
<p>The second umbrella topic for LinkedIn users to utilize when employing content marketing principles on LinkedIn is to utilize all the features made available to them. Just a handful are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Pages</strong> - LinkedIn allows a single business to showcase up to ten different brands. For example, Pepsi has a brand for both Pepsi and Pepsi Max. Both of these link back to Pepsi’s news, network, and career openings.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Messages</strong> - LinkedIn provides businesses with the ability to funnel messages to followers. This is part of their InMail messaging service.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - By creating or activly participating in groups, businesses can create a subnetwork of people interested in a specific topic or company. This also allows businesses to control the conversation by posting jobs, polls, and other status updates to a smaller group of interested followers.</li>
<li><strong>User Targeting</strong> - When posting status updates, LinkedIn allows businesses to select certain audience segments to show content to. This keeps the right content going to the right people, this being more relevant and engaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, LinkedIn does offer the ability for companies to post ads using a service called “Sponsored Posts”. Currently, LinkedIn only makes about 22% of their revenues from this service, so it’s not one of their most focused on revenue streams. It does offer a good opportunity to showcase a business tool or service though. When using this, businesses should keep in mind that users of LinkedIn come to the site to network and be in a professional environment, so ads for non-business related products are not well suited for this service.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="Case-Study-Deloitte"><a href="#Case-Study-Deloitte" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: Deloitte"></a>Case Study: Deloitte</h4><p>Deloitte is one of the best examples of a company effectively using LinkedIn for content marketing. Deloitte is a management consulting company which works on a multinational level across several different sectors. Their LinkedIn page speaks to this level of expertise perfectly.</p>
<p>To start, their page gives a good overview of their company and what they are about. Users can easily reach their country-specific Deloitte page, as well as seeing a featured link to Deloitte University Press, their in-house publishing department. Users can also easily find an active and up to date job board, showing that Deloitte’s social media staff is active in keeping things up to date.</p>
<p>Scrolling further down, Deloitte has a stream of recent news articles they have posted. There is a great mix of both shared content and in-house generated content, as well as several comments on each post to keep the conversation going. This section is key to Deloitte’s success on social media. Thanks to being able to share this news to their wide audience, they show that they are keeping up with daily news and trends. Their in-house content also speaks to the quality level of their consulting team, something most brands don’t think to implement on social media.</p>

<h3 id="Snapchat"><a href="#Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat"></a>Snapchat</h3><h4 id="What-is-Snapchat"><a href="#What-is-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="What is Snapchat?"></a>What is Snapchat?</h4><p>Snapchat is a quickly growing social network based around showing images which disappear after a number of seconds. Even though this technology has only been around a few years, it has walked quite the path towards finding relevancy. In it’s early years, it was seen as primarily a tool used be teenagers for sending photos which would not fare well in public, such as party photos or sexting. Quickly though, the addictiveness of quickly sending photos with a short message branched out into the platform catching on as an alternative to texting.</p>
<p>Recently, Snapchat has taken several steps to mature. Recent features introduced include the ability to have actual text conversations, as well as two which are very relevant towards businesses. First, Snapchat introduced “stories”, or a series of images by a certain user which show a series of images from the past 24 hours. This extends the traditional ephemeral messaging model Snapchat started with. The second innovation Snapchat recently released was the ability to link to a debit card and send money through the app. This feature is easy to do, just enter $xx to a person and the money will be sent.</p>
<h4 id="How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Snapchat"><a href="#How-can-entrepreneurs-use-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How can entrepreneurs use Snapchat?"></a>How can entrepreneurs use Snapchat?</h4><p>Though it doesn’t have the ability to showcase a brand or have a strong presence, nor is it the most professional forum, Snapchat does boast a user base of 32.9% of millennials aged 18-34.[^fn-snap-usage] Businesses should go to where their customer is, and Snapchat is just that. The issue with focusing on Snapchat is this: there is not yet a public paid advertising service and discovery is tough. Much like Instagram, Snapchat is a very personal service and ads on there should reflect as much. As such, they are taking a very slow approach to opening up their advertising program. They only allow a handful of companies to show ads, and they do not prioritize them on a user’s feed. There also is the issue of discovery. Without hashtags or any sort of “sticky” messaging, it is tough for brands to create buzz on the network. Instead, they are limited to pushing stories to the people who voluntarily choose to follow them.</p>
<p>A second interesting aspect of Snapchat is that they are now allowing payments on the service. By linking to a debit card, users can easily send money to others. Though there are to tools for businesses to use this so far, it isn’t a stretch to see Snapchat turning into a sort of shopping or auction platform in the future. Payments would be effortless, with users being able to pay in a matter of just a few taps.</p>
<p>Snapchat is definitely still on the frontier of social networks, not something which most companies should focus on quite yet. It is something to keep an eye on though. Between it’s foray into money transfers and it’s fledgling advertising program, it could become the perfect service for reaching millennials.  </p>

<h4 id="Case-Study-NBA"><a href="#Case-Study-NBA" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: NBA"></a>Case Study: NBA</h4><p>Most of Snapchat’s successful marketing campaigns are not based around advertising, but instead generating buzz. One such example is the NBA. During the 2014 draft, the NBA posted a number of behind the scenes clips and photos to fans who follow the league. This generated a large amount of buzz and prompted more fans to tune in to the televised production. It also seems a very personal message, as opposed to an online ad for anyone to see.</p>

<h2 id="SEO-Recommendations"><a href="#SEO-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="SEO Recommendations"></a>SEO Recommendations</h2><p>Modern day SEO best practices are based around creating clean, semantic code. Unlike 5 or 10 years ago, when all that was needed was a few meta tags in the header to tell what the website is about, search engines factor in a variety of content to surface the most relevant sites while excluding spam.</p>
<p>Several factors go into this complicated formula for search engine placement. Most important is incorporating relevant content and keywords into the site. This keyword density is key for search engines to understand what a website is talking about or what industry and skill sets a business is experienced in. Also important is having other sites link back to your site. This is called cross-linking, which lends a site credibility with it’s peers.</p>
<p>Other best practices include having a mobile version of the site, enhancing page-load speed, serving pages over SSL, and having a well-structured, semantic site. All of these factors come together to show a search engine that a site is credible, informative, and user friendly.</p>
<p>One word of caution, there are commercial services which will create tons of links back to a site or vastly increase a follower count on social media. Though the short term gains of these sites are great, they can result in a site or account being banned or not surfaced to potential users. They should be avoided at all costs.</p>

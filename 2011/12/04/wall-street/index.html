There’s no doubt that there are currently tens of thousands of people all around the nation, and the globe, who want to make their voice heard about the inequality of wealth… and they are succeeding in getting noticed. The question is, how effective is Occupy Wall Street? In it’s current form, Occupy Wall Street has potential, but it lacks the leadership, unity, and direction that will allow it to succeed in the long term.</p>
<p>Basically, Occupy Wall Street is a movement which is attempting to provide a political and economic voice for the 99% of people who aren’t currently holding the top 40% of the wealth in the United States of America. It started in New York City on the seventeenth of September of 2011 and it’s initial purpose  was to protest corporate greed by the upper 1 percent of people in America (Scherer). Since then, Occupy Wall Street has grown to encompass all sorts of political and economic issues affecting the commonfolk of the United States. Issues such as subsidies for big business, high fees imposed by the major financial institutions, and the pervasiveness of lobbying in our nation’s capital have also taken center stage in the Occupy Wall Street Movement. By the 10th of October, Occupy Wall Street had really begun to take off around the nation and in some of the other major cities around the globe. With this came fragmentation and/or expansions of the initially stated goals of the movement. For example, in Oakland, California, protesters are stating local school closures, waning union benefits and cuts to social services as additional reasons why they are protesting (MSNBC).</p>
<p>Although Occupy Wall Street is powerful movement that’s taken the world by storm, it doesn’t have an actual leader, or even a collective of people with leadership roles. Started by a small number of extreme liberals and social disruptors at the request of Adbusters, an anti-consumerist magazine, the movement has been a leaderless movement from the very beginning (according to the Occupy Wall Street website). This can create some very interesting challenges to those who are participating in the Occupy movement. For starters, without any central leadership, various Occupy Wall Street movements don’t always have similar goals. In some areas, protesters may be marching for a lack of school funding. In others, they may be marching to protest bank fees; and in some areas they may be marching to protest consumerism. Without leadership, there is no central, definable message or clearly defined goals that can be referenced to determine what protesters want. The downsides to this are many, and have the possibility of completely derailing the movement. For example, if one faction of Occupy Wall Street were to start protesting something that the other offshoots of the movements didn’t agree with, it could cause a schism within the group which could cause many people to leave. Another potential downside to not having a central message is that some people could start doing activities which wasn’t in line with what the core of the movement believed, but still giving the entire movement a bad name. For example, when “Occupy Oakland” blocked off a shipping port in October of 2011, there were a few people who decided to cause vandalism to area businesses. Even though the majority of the group stressed peaceful protest techniques, some of the public could have misinterpreted the violent actions of a few to be representative of the whole.</p>
<p>Another issue stemming up from the lack of leadership is the absence of a central figure representing the movement. Throughout history, almost all major movements have had a leader who is able to communicate to and negotiate with governments, businesses, and the media. Take for instance the civil rights movement; leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X led their own movements and as such served as a spokesperson for their entire following. Even modern, seemingly leaderless movements typically need a handful of core leaders to guide the actions of the many. For example, in Egypt, it was the leaders of the Rebel forces who decided how to go about overthrowing the existing regime. Based on both history and the events which have taken place as part of Occupy Wall Street, the Occupy protesters will be hard pressed to communicate a focused, highly effective agenda without a strong, central leadership.</p>
<p>Even without centralized leadership, there is still hope for Occupy Wall Street. Thanks to modern media, social networking, and some of the ideas employed at protests in the Middle East and India, there is still hope for the Occupy Wall Street Movement. In recent years. the media has been on of the strongest platforms for change. Take for instance the uprisings in Iran a few years ago. Because of Twitter, masses of people had an easy way to get the word out about their campaign and the oppression that they were under. Another example is the “Arab Spring” movements which took place in the spring of 2011. Facebook and Twitter allowed for the organization of masses of people so that they were able to organize a protest against oppressive governments in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other nations. A collective of social media users were able to make their voices heard and their opinions known. They organized peaceful protests, marches, and rallies. Eventually, they were successful in overthrowing their governments and creating change. According to a professor at UW who is researching the effects of social media on social movements, social networks such as Twitter play a pivotal role uprisings because they often catch the older, non-technical leadership by surprise. (Casey). Just like Arab nations were able to leverage social media to overthrow entire governments, Occupy Wall Street actually has a chance because of their presence on these sites. The protesters used YouTube to show examples of police brutality, they used Twitter to organize their masses, and they used Facebook to draw support from the public. Occupy Wall Street is using the same tactics. Thanks to social media, protesters got the word out about police brutality and possible infringements on their first amendment rights (the entrapment on the Brooklyn Bridge, brutality in the Oakland protests, etc). Even though it wasn’t until the mainstream media started showing the video caught by the protesters that the majority of Americans heard about the protests, that wouldn’t have been possible without the citizen reporters who were part of the throng of protesters.[FS㓀ఞ㓀뿿1]  Since this footage is available to anyone online, it has the potential to expand all through the world, from Europe to Africa. The usage of social media in the Occupy Wall Street campaign brings a new precedent to the famous phrase, “The whole world is watching.” Social media is also used for planning events though, not just reporting on them. Through Facebook events and blog posts, protesters are able to create events to take place in various cities. The public is able to easily find others who want to support a movement just by typing in a keyword such as “Occupy Akron”. This pulls up a list of all events which are held in Akron with their dates and times. This allows anyone to be informed about how to participate. Thanks to social media, anyone is able to join in with the hive of activity which surrounds the Occupy Wall Street protests. The other great thing about being able to address so many people at once is that movements can take place all around the world at one time, helping to speed up change. In comparison to other social movements, like the Progressive Era, which took roughly 20 years to bring about social change, there is a possibility for Occupy Wall Street’s push for social change to take place in a very small amount of time.</p>
<p>So far, the Occupy Wall Street movement has had a huge success as far as getting the word out about their grievances and telling people about their movement, but the political impact hasn’t been near as successful. Despite being acknowledged by some of the world’s most powerful leaders, for example, President Obama, they are still short of gaining their public support. Even though congress has recognized that the protesters are dissatisfied with the way things are, many of the leaders are dismissing the movement as a small faction of the public with extremist views. In the past, most movements have only gained success by infiltrating the halls of our capitol. Take for instance the civil rights protests. Leaders were able to present their views to congress and negotiate with leaders for legislation giving them what they were demanding. There are more recent examples of movements enacting change through establishing a position in congress. When the Tea Party first started, most of the public dismissed them as a meaningless cause that would fizzle out; once they gained seats in congress though, they were able to have a strong impact on politics. Because the Occupy Wall Street protesters haven’t yet come up with a method of making their voices heard in politics, whether by talking to our nation’s leaders, or by establishing a position as one of our nation’s leaders, it’s lacking the voice needed to make it a successful movement.</p>
<p>There is a potential for great political and economic change to happen in the coming weeks and months. There is a huge movement, growing in size daily, that doesn’t show any signs of slowing down or letting up. The protesters of Occupy Wall Street have yet to come up with an actual plan though. They don’t have a shared list of grievances and goals. They haven’t yet found a way to make their voices heard by our nation’s leaders. Above all, they don’t currently have a method of leadership which will allow their protest to be powerful and adaptable to anything that comes in their way. The movement hasn’t yet utilized their full power and influence, and as such, isn’t yet near as powerful or effective as it has the potential to be.</p>
